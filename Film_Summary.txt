Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005), directed by Park Chan-wook, follows Lee Geum-ja, a woman who is released from prison after serving 13 years for the kidnapping and murder of a young boy—a crime she did not commit. During her sentence, she cultivated a reputation for angelic behavior, winning favor with guards and inmates alike. Yet beneath her gentle facade, she carefully plotted revenge against the real killer, a man who manipulated her into taking the fall.
Upon gaining her freedom, Geum-ja immediately begins executing her plan. She reconnects with individuals she helped in prison, calling in favors to gather resources and information. As she tracks down Mr. Baek, the true murderer, she wrestles with her own guilt, especially after being reunited with the daughter she was forced to give up. Her transformation becomes both emotional and moral as she confronts the consequences of her past choices.
The story reaches a moral and psychological climax when Geum-ja discovers the full extent of Mr. Baek’s crimes—multiple murdered children—and gathers the victims’ parents, giving them the chance to exact justice themselves. What begins as a pure revenge mission evolves into a shared reckoning with grief, rage, and vengeance. The film ultimately explores themes of redemption, responsibility, and the messy, painful pursuit of closure in a world where forgiveness and justice rarely align neatly.
